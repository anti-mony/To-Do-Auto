==========

## ICP Project (Group " J ") || CSD101 Project

<p> A to-do list which prioritizes on it's own. </p>
    Something that makes your decisions a bit easier i.e. a bit Ideal.

#### LIST OF FILES

1. Everything complete is put in Total Project Folder.

* All the files that store priorities of words. Our so called database.

2. Everything outside.

* The ".cpp" files are just bits of code of the program. 

* "Key.xlsx" contains the key words , not completely but close to maximum.

* "Log.docx" contains the log of our meetings , totally unmaintained.



#### HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
